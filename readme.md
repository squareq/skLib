# BCD-skLib
A working version of the abandoned skript addon, skLib, for my projects.  
For the most part, the plugin was designed with only my projects in mind, because of this it may only contain the necessary features, however I do make an effort to offer support for most other Skript-Servers interested in using it. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/squareq/skLib/issues) to request for any improvements or additions.
